   abstract = {Power quality problems are now receiving much interest from the distribution system operators (DSO). This can be attributed to rising competition in today's electricity markets, new regulations and standards regarding the power quality, and also because newer types of load equipment require certain levels of power quality. Furthermore, the current trend towards increased penetration of distributed generation (DG) in the distribution network (in particular electronics interfaced and intermittent DG) has its impact on the power quality performance of the distribution networks, which also draw more attention of the DSOs to the power quality issues. The research presented in the thesis is divided into two main parts; the first part is to estimate and evaluate power quality indices in distribution networks with DG. By comparing the estimated PQ performance with the customers' PQ requirements the weak areas of the network are identified, i.e., the areas requiring power quality improvements. Most of the PQ phenomena are well defined in international standards and appropriate thresholds for individual phenomena are set in these standards. The thesis presents simulation and evaluation methodologies for some of the main PQ phenomena. Particular attention is given to the longer terms study of harmonics in distribution network with limited monitoring. The second part deals with the optimum provision of differentiated power quality based on the temporal and spatial variations of the network state and the customers' power quality requirements. Two new global PQ indices are developed to evaluate the overall PQ of a bus in compressed format. The proposed global indices are the Compound Bus PQ Index (CBPQI) which is based on Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) methodology and the PQ Reserve index (PQR) which is based on weighted average of performance of different phenomena. The CBPQI is then used as an objective function to optimize the selection of the PQ mitigation solutions. This involves utilising the available power quality mitigation solutions and considering the new smart technologies for network operation in order to provide the optimum level of power quality to different areas of the network at different times. The research outcomes contribute to the benchmarking of power quality performance, quantifying the impact of DG on the power quality in the networks, and to identifying the areas of distribution networks where the investments in power quality monitors and solutions should be made. The studies presented in the thesis are based on both simulations and real PQ measurements. All the simulations are performed in DigSilent PowerFactory and OpenDSS simulation software packages. The studies are performed on a generic distribution network and a real distribution feeder.},

   abstract = {This study presents a thorough analysis of the effect of load models on frequency response, small and large disturbance stability of the power system, in order to identify the type of stability exhibiting most sensitivity to load models, and for each type of studied stability to pinpoint the load model that has the worst effect. The presented analysis shows clearly that transient stability is the most sensitive to load models. The number of unstable cases varies considerably with each type of studied load model. The effect of the load model magnifies with the reduction in headroom of synchronous generators. The results of frequency response of the system following an active power disturbance demonstrate that the influence of constant power loads can be significant if the system is operating with reduced primary frequency response at high load. High integration of renewable energy sources (RES) increases the variation in the damping of electromechanical modes due to increased uncertainties, and a high proportion of induction machines can reduce the damping of inter-area modes considerably, making a well stable mode unstable for certain operating points. The influence of load models has been illustrated using a 68-bus system with 30% and 52% penetration of RES.},

   abstract = {This paper discusses the effect of energy storage systems (ESS) on power
system stability. The paper first
demonstrates the improvement in frequency nadir with ESS. Following this, the effect of the energy storage system (ESS) on small signal stability is investigated. The analysis is further extended to explore the contribution of ESS to improve transient stability by using the same ESS controls and parameter setting. The results demonstrate as expected that ESS can provide an enhanced primary frequency response to reduce the drop in frequency nadir. Small signal stability analysis shows that frequency control coupled with active power control does not affect the damping of interarea modes while voltage control can reduce the damping of these modes. The results also indicate that ESS installed to provide primary frequency support can also contribute to the improvement of transient stability of the system. The studies are performed in the modified version of IEEE 16 machine, 68 bus network.},
