   title = {Estimation and provision of differentiated quality of supply in distribution networks},
   university = {University of Manchester},
   abstract = {Power quality problems are now receiving much interest from the distribution system operators (DSO). This can be attributed to rising competition in today's electricity markets, new regulations and standards regarding the power quality, and also because newer types of load equipment require certain levels of power quality. Furthermore, the current trend towards increased penetration of distributed generation (DG) in the distribution network (in particular electronics interfaced and intermittent DG) has its impact on the power quality performance of the distribution networks, which also draw more attention of the DSOs to the power quality issues. The research presented in the thesis is divided into two main parts; the first part is to estimate and evaluate power quality indices in distribution networks with DG. By comparing the estimated PQ performance with the customers' PQ requirements the weak areas of the network are identified, i.e., the areas requiring power quality improvements. Most of the PQ phenomena are well defined in international standards and appropriate thresholds for individual phenomena are set in these standards. The thesis presents simulation and evaluation methodologies for some of the main PQ phenomena. Particular attention is given to the longer terms study of harmonics in distribution network with limited monitoring. The second part deals with the optimum provision of differentiated power quality based on the temporal and spatial variations of the network state and the customers' power quality requirements. Two new global PQ indices are developed to evaluate the overall PQ of a bus in compressed format. The proposed global indices are the Compound Bus PQ Index (CBPQI) which is based on Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) methodology and the PQ Reserve index (PQR) which is based on weighted average of performance of different phenomena. The CBPQI is then used as an objective function to optimize the selection of the PQ mitigation solutions. This involves utilising the available power quality mitigation solutions and considering the new smart technologies for network operation in order to provide the optimum level of power quality to different areas of the network at different times. The research outcomes contribute to the benchmarking of power quality performance, quantifying the impact of DG on the power quality in the networks, and to identifying the areas of distribution networks where the investments in power quality monitors and solutions should be made. The studies presented in the thesis are based on both simulations and real PQ measurements. All the simulations are performed in DigSilent PowerFactory and OpenDSS simulation software packages. The studies are performed on a generic distribution network and a real distribution feeder.},

   abstract = {This study presents a thorough analysis of the effect of load models on frequency response, small and large disturbance stability of the power system, in order to identify the type of stability exhibiting most sensitivity to load models, and for each type of studied stability to pinpoint the load model that has the worst effect. The presented analysis shows clearly that transient stability is the most sensitive to load models. The number of unstable cases varies considerably with each type of studied load model. The effect of the load model magnifies with the reduction in headroom of synchronous generators. The results of frequency response of the system following an active power disturbance demonstrate that the influence of constant power loads can be significant if the system is operating with reduced primary frequency response at high load. High integration of renewable energy sources (RES) increases the variation in the damping of electromechanical modes due to increased uncertainties, and a high proportion of induction machines can reduce the damping of inter-area modes considerably, making a well stable mode unstable for certain operating points. The influence of load models has been illustrated using a 68-bus system with 30% and 52% penetration of RES.},

The analysis is further extended to explore the contribution of ESS to improve transient stability by using the same ESS controls and parameter setting. The results demonstrate as expected that ESS can provide an enhanced primary frequency response to reduce the drop in frequency nadir. Small signal stability analysis shows that frequency control coupled with active power control does not affect the damping of interarea modes while voltage control can reduce the damping of these modes. The results also indicate that ESS installed to provide primary frequency support can also contribute to the improvement of transient stability of the system. The studies are performed in the modified version of IEEE 16 machine, 68 bus network.},

   abstract = {Electric energy generation from renewable energy sources is generally non-dispatchable due to its intrinsic volatility. Therefore, its integration into electricity markets and in power system operation is often based on volatility-compensating energy storage systems. Scheduling and control of this kind of coupled systems is usually based on hierarchical control and optimization. On the upper level, one solves an optimization problem to compute a dispatch schedule and a coherent allocation of energy reserves. On the lower level, one performs online adjustments of the dispatch schedule using, for example, model predictive control. In the present paper, we propose a formulation of the upper level optimization based on data-driven probabilistic forecasts of the power and energy output of the uncontrollable loads and generators dependent on renewable energy sources. Specifically, relying on probabilistic forecasts of both power and energy profiles of the uncertain demand/generation, we propose a novel framework to ensure the online feasibility of the dispatch schedule with a given security level. The efficacy of the proposed scheme is illustrated by simulations based on real household production and consumption data.},

Stochastic renewable generations, random loads, dynamic thermal ratings, and failure probabilities of outdoor power devices are all influenced by diverse meteorological factors. To integrate the probabilistic impacts of multiple meteorological factors and their resulting uncertainties, a new nested sampling framework for probabilistic operational reliability evaluation of composite power systems is proposed. As one critical step of the framework, a general modeling method to fit the probability distribution of each meteorological factor at each time point by historical weather records is presented in details, and several specific distributions are introduced for the first time to refine the accuracy ofprobabilistic weather representation. In subsequent tests, the actual failure records and corresponding meteorological data are used to validate the performance of the proposed framework. Several existing methods, considering but not fully considering meteorological effects, are adopted for comparisons to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in the test case. As one benefit of the proposed framework, uncertainty importance measures of all involved random variables are available and discussed as well.},

the allocation of photovoltaic (PV) generation, solar irradiance, and its impact on the power flow in a distribution network. The solar irradiance available in the National Renewable Energy Laboratory Resource Data Center is clustered into two states: high and low irradiance defined by a threshold. The uncertainty is modeled based on Non-Gaussian distribution, obtained using kernel density estimation. This estimation aids in achieving the probability density function and cumulative distribution functions of the solar irradiance. Moreover, the load demand, wind speed, and generator location are modeled according to Gaussian, Weibull, and discrete uniform distribution functions, respectively. As a part of probabilistic power flow, the backward/forward sweep method is used to solve each scenario of the Monte Carlo simulation. The proposed framework is applied to the 33-node test system considering three different test cases. The first case considers deployment of PV systems in three microgrids of the electric grid, and the other two test cases analyze different levels of penetration of randomly allocated PV and wind power systems. At the end, the results indicate potential reverse power flow through certain branches of the grid, and the renewables have a major impact on the system.},

A proposal is formulated and evaluated here for the case of solar power generation, when only powerand meteorological measurements are available, without sky-imaging and information about cloud passages. Our empirical investigation reveals that the distribution offorecast errors do not follow any ofthe common parametric densities. This therefore motivates the proposal of a nonparametric approach to generate very short-term predictive densities, i.e., for lead times between a few minutes to one hour ahead, with fast frequency updates. We rely on an Extreme LearningMachine (ELM) as a fast regression model, trained in varied ways to obtain both point and quantile forecasts of solar power generation. Four probabilistic methods are implemented as benchmarks. Rival approaches are evaluated based on a number of test cases for two solar power generation sites in different climatic regions, allowing us to show that our approach results in generation of skilful and reliable probabilistic forecasts in a computationally efficient manner.},

   pages = {6539-6565},
   abstract = {Due to the growth of electric end-uses, the management of the variations in time of the electric power demand has become essential, especially in the residential sector. According to this issue, the anticipation of the power demand is of great interest. This implies a better knowledge of the electric load curve of the household stock. Papers about understanding and forecasting energy demand are numerous but studies on building’s load curves are rare. In this paper we propose a cross analysis of some existing methods capable of building up a residential electric load curve. Two main types of load curve models have been identified in the literature: top-down and bottom-up methods. Even if the review presents two existing top-down approaches, the authors focused the further analysis on bottom-up models. For each of them we first identify its functional characteristics: finality and scope, input data required, output format, modeled appliances and end-uses covered, generation of the diversity and validation of the model. Secondly, we establish a bloc diagram representing its architecture with focus on the mathematical model chosen. Finally, the authors list the limits of the model in view of the criteria needed to build up an ideal, bottom-up and technically explicit load curve model for the residential sector. A cross reading of the different methodologies is proposed through a global table that characterizes
and sums up the analyzed models. Moreover, a graphical representation of the models studied is proposed, according to three criteria (range of application, modelling of the diversity, time scale accuracy) that allows us to compare them ‘‘at a glance’’. To conclude, an identification of the gaps among existing models is proposed. It consists of listing the end-uses, the appliances and other behavioural correlations which may affect the load curve and that are not included in the reviewed methodologies and need further research.},

   title = {Probabilistic Transient Stability Assessment and Corrective Control of Power Systems with Increasing Penetration of Non-synchronous Generation},
   abstract = {In recent times, the operation of electrical power systems has been changed by two key factors. Firstly, by the liberalisation of the electricity market in many parts around the world, and more recently, by a growing integration of power plants using Renewable Energy Sources (RES) into the network, particularly wind and solar based. The main features of these sources of energy are their inherently highly stochastic behaviour, and that their connection to the network is currently made in a non-synchronous inertialess manner through power inverters. This means that in the years to come, power networks will become much more uncertain while at the same time operating with considerably lower levels of inertia. This thesis investigates the effects of the penetration of highly stochastic, non-synchronous RES generation, on power systems transient stability. The thesis contributes to the area of power systems stability research, particularly surrounding the effects of non-synchronous RES generation on first-swing transient stability. The detailed transient stability assessment of different test networks with increasing non-synchronous RES generation was performed, starting from the study of the basic principles through deterministic analyses of single-machine networks, and extending to probabilistic analyses of realistic multi-machine systems. The results provide a full view of how different parameters and operating conditions of the network are altered by the inclusion of RES generation, and how all these changes actually affect the transient stability of the system, making it easy to generalise the learned concepts to any network so that the actual influence of the high penetration of RES on first-swing transient stability can be readily assessed and understood. A probabilistic approach using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations is formally proposed for the stability assessment of uncertain power networks, including the introduction of new indices for complementing the analysis. Following these investigations, a robust methodology for the identification of the critical rotor oscillation patterns occurring in realistic multi-machine power networks using Hierarchical Clustering (HC) is developed. The method also includes the proposal of new statistic measures for the assessment of the quality of clusters in order to find the optimal clustering parameters, so as to guarantee that the most representative and actually critical oscillation patterns are found. Finally, a practical systematic procedure using the information from the proposed HC approach is developed for the optimal implementation or deployment, either in real time or for planning purposes, of corrective actions for the improvement of transient stability. The main outcomes of this research are the comprehensive assessment of how the increasing penetration of inertialess RES generation actually affects the transient stability of power systems, particularly in the first-swing, and the development of a methodology for the effective deployment of corrective measures for its improvement.},

The proposed methodology uses importance sampling to focus on conditions which contain the high information content required to make relevant decisions about low probability events. Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) is used to efficiently bound the search space and identify operating conditions leading to a marginally stable or unstable system response. The proposed approach is demonstrated on a model of a multi-area transmission network with a significant capacity of intermittent generation connected through a multi-terminal voltage source converter-based high voltage direct current (VSC-HVDC) grid. It is demonstrated that the methodology yields accurate results with just a small fraction of the sample points required using a conventional numerical MC approach.},

To reduce the computational efforts by using conventional Monte Carlo simulations, we develop and employ a computationally efficient method to assess the probabilistic ADC, which combines the up-to-date sparse polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) and the continuation method. Particularly, the proposed method is able to handle a large number of correlated random inputs with different marginal distributions. Numerical examples in the IEEE 13 and IEEE 123 node test feeders are presented, showing that the proposed method can achieve accuracy and efficiency simultaneously. Numerical results also demonstrate that the randomness brought about by the RES and loads indeed leads to a reduction in the delivery capability of a distribution network.},

   abstract = {The randomness and intermittence of wind resources is the biggest challenge in the integration of wind power into the power system. Accurate forecasting of wind power generation is an efficient tool to deal with such problem. Conventional wind power forecasting produces a value, or the conditional expectation of wind power output at a time point in the future. However, any prediction involves inherent uncertainty. In recent years, several probabilistic forecasting approaches have been reported in wind power forecasting studies. Compared to currently wide-used point forecasts, probabilistic forecasts could provide additional quantitative information on the uncertainty associated with wind power generation. For decision-makings in the uncertainty environment, probabilistic forecasts are optimal inputs. A review of state-of-the-art methods and new developments in wind power probabilistic forecasting is presented in this paper. Firstly, three different representations of wind power uncertainty are briefly introduced. Then, different forecasting methods are discussed. These methods are classified into three categories in terms of uncertainty representation, i.e. probabilistic forecasts (parametric and non-parametric), risk index forecasts and space-time scenario forecasts. Finally, requirements and the overall framework of the uncertainty forecasting evaluation are summarized. In addition, this article also describes current challenges and future developments associated with wind power probabilistic prediction.},
